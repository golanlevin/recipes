A *tadka* is a cooking method where spices and other aromatics are cooked briefly in hot oil and ghee to bring out their best flavor. It then gets added to a *dal* (lentil curry) to infuse that recipe with its flavor.

Dal refers to lentils. Tadka means “tempering” (infusing fat, typically oil or ghee, with spices and aromatics). This involves heating oil or ghee, adding spices like cumin seeds, dried red chili peppers, and curry leaves to infuse flavors into the oil. This flavored oil is poured on top of the completed dish. So, dal tadka or tadka dal is basically a simmered lentil base with the tempering poured on top.

## RECIPE 1: [Simple Indian Dal Tadka](https://urbanfarmie.com/dal-tadka/)

#### Ingredients

**For making lentils:**

* 1 cup toor dal (*split yellow pigeon peas – substitute with moong dal or masoor dal as needed*)
* 4 cups water for stove top (*use 2.5 cups for Instant Pot or pressure cooker*)
* 1 tsp turmeric

**For making dal base:**

* 1 tsp ghee
* 1 tsp cumin seeds
* 2 tomato (*medium, chopped*)
* 1/2 onion (*medium, chopped*)
* 1-2 Thai green chili pepper (*Thai chili preferred, use Serrano otherwise*)
* 1/4 tsp Kashmiri red chili powder
* 1 tsp coriander powder
* 1 tsp cumin powder
* 1.5 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp cilantro (*chopped*)

**For the the tadka, i.e. tempering:**

* 1 tbsp ghee
* 1 tsp mustard seeds
* 1 tsp cumin seeds
* 2-3 dried Indian red chili peppers (*optional*)
* 1/4 tsp Kashmiri red chili powder (*substitute with paprika*)

#### Instructions

**Make the lentils:**

* Rinse and clean lentils thoroughly, a couple of times typically does the trick – soak in water for 15 mins 
* Drain lentils, add water and turmeric – cover and bring to boil (2-3 mins). If it foams, skim it off.
* When water starts bubbling vigorously, reduce heat to a simmer (low to medium) for ~30 minutes – if lentils feel hard, cook for 5 more minutes.
* Final product should be soft, with some liquid left – if there's a ton of additional liquid, drain into a cup and save some for later (for when you make the dal base)

**Make the dal base:**

* 5 mins before lentils are cooked, heat ghee in a pan and add cumin seeds – toast for a minute
* Add chopped onions, green chili – saute until fragrant (~3 min) 
* Add tomatoes and deglaze pan (i.e. crush tomatoes to release juices) 
* Add cumin powder, coriander powder, chili powder and salt and mix well – this is the dal base and cook together for 3 to 5 minutes (paprika works here too)
* Add dal base to the lentils and let it cook, covered for 5 minutes – add up to half a cup of reserved water to get dal to your desired consistency

**Make the tadka:**

* While the lentils are cooking, prepare the tadka in the same pan you used for the dal base: add ghee, and let it melt 
* Once ghee has melted, add mustard and cumin seeds – let it splutter 
* Add dried red chili (optional) + red chili powder and mix (~30 seconds) 
* Pour tadka over cooked dal, garnish with chopped cilantro and serve hot 

**Notes**

* You’ll need both a pot and a pan for this recipe – use the pan for making the dal base and the tadka/tempering
* You can use toor, moong or masoor to make dal tadka. When lentils are fresh, they take ~20 – 45 minutes to cook stove-top. Moong dal takes 20 minutes, toor dal about 30 minutes, and masoor dal takes about 45 minutes. In a pressure cooker or an Instant Pot, all the lentils take roughly 8-9 minutes.
* While tempering: if you use raw spices, add them first to the ghee or oil. If you’re using ground spices, add them together and cook for a short amount to prevent burning.
