## Mohnkuchen (Austrian Poppy Seed Cake)

Gluten-free poppy seed cake resembling the *Mohnschnitte* sold in the [Linz k.u.k. Hofbäckerei Café](https://xn--kuk-hofbckerei-dib.at/). Recipe [adapted from Bowen Appétit](www.bowenappetit.com/2014/03/12/mohnkuchen-austrian-poppy-seed-cake/), adapted from [The Traveler's Lunchbox](https://travelerslunchbox.com/2006/03/28/one-year-later/). *Makes about 12 servings.*

### Ingredients

* 1 3/4 cups (9 3/8 oz.) blue or black poppy seeds
* 10 Tbsp. (1 1/4 sticks or 5 oz.) butter, room temperature
* 5 eggs, separated
* 1 cup (7 oz.) sugar
* Pinch of salt
* 1/2 cup (4 oz.) heavy cream
* 2 tsp. vanilla
* Whipped cream, Greek yogurt, or ice cream, for serving

*See optional Mürbeteig (German Shortcrust Pastry), below*. 

### *Instructions*

1. **Preheat** oven to 350F.
2. **Prepare** a 9-inch round pan by buttering lightly. A springform or removable-bottom pan would be best here.
3. **Grind**. Using a [mohnmuhle](https://www.amazon.com/Manual-Poppy-Grain-Operated-Grinder/dp/B07GDK66LB/) (poppy seed grinder), grind the poppy seeds into a coarse paste, similar to the texture of wet soil or sand. A coffee/spice grinder works also.
4. **Beat the butter and eggs**. Beat the butter with a stand mixer or handheld mixer on medium-high until completely smooth, about 1 minute. Keeping the mixer on, add the egg yolks one at a time and continue beating for 2 minutes after the addition of the last yolk. Add the sugar and beat in until incorporated.
5. **Beat the egg whites**. If using a stand mixer, completely clean the butter mixture out of the bowl and put into a medium mixing bowl. It’s important you wash the bowl with soap and water to remove all traces of fat, or the egg whites won’t beat. (If you have a second mixing bowl, utilize that for the egg whites). If you’re using a handheld mixer, simply wash the beaters. Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they form soft peaks.
6. **Combine and add remaining ingredients**. Stir about 1/4 of the beaten egg whites into the butter mixture. (This helps lighten the mixture so that it can be more easily integrated with the rest of the egg whites.) Now fold the rest of the egg whites into the batter, trying to work them as little as possible. Fold in the poppy seeds, then the cream and vanilla.
7. **Bake**. Spread the batter evenly in the pan and bake until the cake is puffed and golden brown, about 40 minutes. The middle should feel somewhat dry but pressing lightly in the center may leave a slight indent. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes. The sides of the cake will likely pull away from the pan and the top will deflate slightly – this is fine. Depending on the pan you’ve used, you can either remove the bottom of the pan from the sides or invert the cake onto a wire rack or serving platter and then again to make it upright again.
8. **Serve** the cake, preferably with whipped cream.

### Storage

This cake lasts well at room temperature for up to 5 days. The edges may dry out a bit, but you can always cut those away if you want. I’m guessing this would also freeze (up to 3 months) and thaw well wrapped in plastic wrap and then foil, though I haven’t tried it.

## Mürbeteig (German Shortcrust Pastry)

The Linz baker adds a base and top lattice made from *Mürbeteig*, a German shortcrust pastry, using a recipe something like the one below, adapted from [here](https://www.germany-insider-facts.com/shortcrust-pastry.html).

This German sweet shortcrust pastry recipe can be used for fruit tarts, cheese cakes, Christmas cookies and many more German dessert recipes.

The secret for a successful Mürbeteig is to use cold ingredients and cool hands. Don't knead the dough too long, it might get crumbly.

The traditional Mürbeteig is based on the 1, 2, 3 principle. That means you use 1 part sugar, 2 parts butter, 3 parts flour. Whether an egg belongs to the recipe, or not, is often discussed. The dough with an egg is less crumbly and easier to handle.

### Ingredients 

*Suitable for a 26cm (10 in) tin:*

* 50g (1/4 cup) sugar
* 100g (1/2 cup) cold butter
* 150g (1 1/4 cup) pastry flour (Type 405)
* 1 egg
* 1 pinch salt
* Additionally, you can flavour with lemon essence or vanilla sugar

### Directions

![egg in hole](shortcrust-pastry.jpg)

1. Sift the flour on a large board or clean table, make a hollow like in the picture above.
2. Add the sugar and the egg into the hollow, cut the cold butter into pieces and put it on the rim.
3. Mix the egg and sugar with your fingertips, then quickly rub butter into the flour and blend all ingredients together. Don't knead too long.
4. Form a ball with the dough, wrap in cling film and let it rest in the fridge for at least half an hour. Quickly knead the dough again, roll it out on a floured table.
5. Grease a flat baking tin, sprinkle with breadcrumbs, put the dough into the tin, prick some holes into the dough to avoid bubbles.
6. Bake at 400°F for about 10 to 15 minutes.

Let the cake rest for 5 minutes and remove it from the tin while still warm. Let it cool on a wire before you top it with fruits.
